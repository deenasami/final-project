    <h2>"engagement" roast chicken</h2>
    <p>Whether you're looking for a "Sunday Kind of Love" or already have it -- apparently <br> 
       Glamour Magazine's got the secret to a proposal -- or just a good old roasted chicken -- <br> 
       in their "100 Recipes Every Woman Should Know" cookbook. The story goes something like <br> 
       this: a fashion editor at Glamour magazine once gave her assistant this recipe on how to <br> 
       roast a chicken. The assistant made it for her boyfriend, who later popped the question. A <br>
       few other women tried it and, behold, got the same results. Who knew it was that easy!? <br>
       So my faithful reader(s?), I feel indebted to share the same recipe with you. I can't <br>
       personally attest to the guaranteed-proposal-test -- but I did change the recipe up a bit, <br>
       maybe that's it. </p>
