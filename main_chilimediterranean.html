    <h2>chili à la mediterranean</h2>
    <p>I've been telling more people about the blog now that I've gotten enough recipes under my belt -- and everyone is so graciously offering their own! This one is from a co-worker who has the most precious baby girl. Because he's always trying to squeeze in vegetables to most dishes, this chili recipe is both tasty and healthy! The ingredient list is also pretty flexible; the main things you'll need are: any kind of ground meat, two cans of any type of beans, can of tomatoes, chili powder, and any kind of green vegetables (optional). I decided to put a slight mediterranean twist on the dish and use chickpeas and navy beans.</p>
